# Cricket-Data-Analytics
I have used cricket T20 world cup (2022) data to build insights on a best 11 players team that we can assemble from the earth that can go and play with aliens. We used bright data web scraping to collect data from espncricinfo website then we performed some data transformation and cleaning in pandas, building dashboards in power bi. 


Created a Power BI report to identify the top 11 players for a T20 cricket team by scraping data from 
ESPNcricinfo with a Brightdata website tool, cleaning and transforming the data with pandas.
• Implemented the result Power BI dashboard to select players for categories (openers, middle 
order/anchors, finishers, all-rounders, specialist fast bowlers) and ultimately choose the top 11 players to 
play in the match.
• Selected team using the Power BI dashboard has a 90% of chances to win the game
